# speedlify

After you make a fast web site, keep it fast by measuring it over time. Read [Use Speedlify to Continuously Measure Site Performance](https://www.zachleat.com/web/speedlify/). Created by [@zachleat](https://www.zachleat.com/).

* Requires Node 12+
* Each file in `_data/sites/*.js` is a category and contains a list of sites for comparison.

## Run locally

_After cloning you’ll probably want to delete the initial `_data/sites/*.js` files and create your own file with a list of your own site URLs!_

```
npm install
npm run test-pages
npm run start
```

* **Run every day or week**: You can set Speedlify to run at a specified interval using a Netlify Build Hook, read more on the Eleventy docs: [Quick Tip #008—Trigger a Netlify Build Every Day with IFTTT](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/netlify-ifttt/).

## Known Limitations

* If you change a URL to remove a redirect (to remove or add a `www.`, moved domains, etc), you probably want to delete the old URL’s data otherwise you’ll have two entries in the results list.
* When running on Netlify, a single category has a max limit on the number of sites it can test, upper bound on how many tests it can complete in the 15 minute Netlify build limit.
* The same URL cannot be listed in two different categories (yet).
